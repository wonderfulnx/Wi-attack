- Description: This repo contains most of the source code for our paper "Wi-attack: Cross-technology Impersonation Attack against iBeacon Services" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9491605). Wi-attack uses widely deployed WiFi APs to conduct attacks on iBeacon services by impersonating an iBeacon base station. It can bring a high distance error when the victim is using iBeacon location service.
- Content: The repo includes the grc file we use to emulate the BLE symbol, the matlab files used to generate an emulated packet and an iPhone App that receives ibeacon and altbeacon packets. Because this project has been finished for quite a while, the included code may not be complete. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.
